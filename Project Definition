Problem definition: As it is known, the world has been dealing with the pandemic and the problems and consequences caused by the pandemic for more than a year. Many areas, sectors and occupations have been caught unprepared for this situation and they have suffered unforeseen losses. Despite this, some sectors have grown rapidly with the help of pandemic conditions, while others have faced serious problems. In this sense, one of the sectors that has suffered huge losses is the tourism sector. Due to the geography of the country in which we live, it has a very important place in the tourism sector worldwide. To understand this situation clearly, I will say that we live in two major cities such as Istanbul and Antalya, thatâ€™s why we can see the negative effects of the pandemic very seriously. Due to the uncertainties in the provinces in which we are located, tourism has largely come to a standstill, and many institutions and organizations operating in this area are taking economic damage. As tourism, which is one of the largest sources of foreign exchange and income for our country, has been disrupted due to the pandemic, we have suffered great losses in economic terms both as the state and as citizens. Especially in tourism-oriented provinces such as Antalya, buesinesses are experiencing difficult times. For this reason, different solutions are being sought to overcome this situation with minimal damage.
