## Project Topic: The COVID19's Effects on Tourism in Turkey
### Informing: Despite the negative impact of the pandemic in many areas, the economic damage is too great to ignore. In this sense, the tourism sector, which is one of the most important sources of income and foreign exchange for Turkey, is literally experiencing a collapse. In this project, we will be addressing the effects of the Covid19 pandemic on tourism in Turkey.
